# XMLSearchTool
This is a university project done in by a team of two with the help of my colleague Malek.
The first part of this project allows two XML files to be chosen from the local repository. It will compare this two files, using two algorithms the first one is Nierman and Jagadish 2002 and the second is using the Vector Space Model.

# Nierman and Jagadish
Using Nierman and Jagadish we compare two XML files return their similarity, generate an edit script and patch either the first file to the second or the second file to the first one.
# Vector Space Model
The Vector Space Model allows similarity to be calculated using TF or TF-IDF (Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency), and either Extended Cosine, Dice, or Jaccard Similariyt. 

# Search Tool
The Search Tool utilizes the VSM to compare a query with a corpus of XML documents. The query can either be an XML query, a natural language query, an XML file, or .txt file. In addition, we added an indexing feature that helps reduce the time complexity of the project. Finally, it ranks the results based on the similarity calculated.

# Tools Used
Python and TKinter
